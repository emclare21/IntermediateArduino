Intermediate arduino assignments. This is coding, wiring, and any complications of each 

## Attach Interrupt
### Description
I used Photointerrupters w/out if statements. Instead, I used an on function and off function. That when the interrupter gets something in the way, it is off and turns on the light, and vice versa. We used an Attach interrupt code that states that when something gets in the way, the code reacts.

### Wiring

### Problems and Solutions
My biggest issue was figuring out how the AttachInterrupt command worked. I figured out that it is specific to Photointerrupters, and that it reads if there is something interrupting the code.


## FadeLED
### Description
I made the brightness of a light fade high to low, and then low to high. An LED goes to a value of 255, so I made the value of the LED go up by 5 until it reaches 255, which then makes the number go down.

## HelloLCD
### Description
The goal was to use an LCD instead of a serial monitor. On one line in the LCD, I printed "Hello World", and on the second line, the LCD counted up the seconds since it started running.

### Problems and Solutions
The main problems I had was wiring everything up. There were a lot of wires to keep track of and the board got quite crowded fast. Follow the diagram exactly as it looks like, and
