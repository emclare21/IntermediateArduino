## Attach Interrupt
### Description
I used Photointerrupters w/out if statements. Instead, I used an on function and off function. That when the interrupter gets something in the way, it is off and turns on the light, and vice versa. We used an Attach interrupt code that states that when something gets in the way, the code reacts.

### Problems and Solutions
My biggest issue was figuring out how the AttachInterrupt command worked. I figured out that it is specific to Photointerrupters, and
